## Задача 26
_A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:_

_1/2	=0.5_

_1/3	=0.⁢(3)_

_1/4	=0.25_

_1/5	=0.2_

_1/6	=0.1⁢(6)_

_1/7	=0.⁢(142857)_

_1/8	=0.125_

_1/9	=0.⁢(1)_

_1/10	=0.1_
 
_Where 0.1⁢(6) means 0.166666⋯, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle._

_Find the value of 𝑑 <1000 for which 1/𝑑 contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part._
